### Contributing and adding features

This package is frozen on 0.x and guaranteed to disappear in the future, so contributing features is not something you probably want to spend time on.

On the other hand, it exists to fill a void in beaker until such time as beaker fills it, so any bugfixes contributed via a github pull request are welcome.

Discussion is available in #puppet-dev on Freenode
